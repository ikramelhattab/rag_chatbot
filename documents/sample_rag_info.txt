This is a sample document to test your RAG chatbot.

## About RAG
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines:
- Information retrieval from a knowledge base
- Natural language generation using AI models

## Benefits of RAG
1. Provides accurate, source-based answers
2. Reduces hallucination in AI responses
3. Allows chatbots to work with specific documents
4. Can work with constantly updated information

## How it works
1. Documents are split into chunks
2. Chunks are converted to embeddings
3. User questions are matched to relevant chunks
4. AI generates responses based on retrieved context
